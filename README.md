# NexClock-v2

I had several 4.3" Nextion displays from another project that was scrapped so I figure I would use them to create a 
Clock/Internet Radio. I am using an Adafruit Huzzah32 and an Adafruit MP3 decoder.  Will be switching to less expensive
ESP32 board.  WROOM has sufficent memory for caching the stream data.
